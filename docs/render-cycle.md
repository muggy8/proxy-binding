## understanding proxymity's render cycle
The proxymity render cycle begin in the [proxymityData object](proxymity-data.md) when a property on it gets changed. This change is detected through the [ES6 Proxy API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) and relevant data are updated. When this happens, it triggers a event to be fired that will resolved on the next javascript event cycle similar to Node's process.nextTick(). This means that you are free to make as many changes to the data object without triggering a re-render of the view. This also ensures that when rendering begins, all other data changes by the client code has already concluded.

The rendering process has 3 main phases. The first phase is the pre-event. in this phase, nothing really happens as this is a often a useful time to obtain debugging data from the internals 

The second phase is the event distribution phase where events are emitted to their listeners in order of when they were added to the queue and the input fields affected by these events are then made to match. This is also the time when any targeted {:___:} are ran as well. Any changes to the length of an array will always cause a rerender of the affected dom sections and then proceeding to updating the other parts

The final phase of the rendering process is to do any clean up related to events. Because the above phase can potentially alter the data again and cause a re-render, this is the phase where the code checks if there are new data updates and if not, it will enter end of rendering procedures and resolve the "renderend" event.
