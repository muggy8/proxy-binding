[X]	: key.end(callback) -> make it actually work
[X]	: default data key -> find one that fits better
[X]	: {{}} -> render on init as well as async start
[X]	: {{}} -> can watch prop and render instead of render on asyncstart only
[X]	: name="prop.{{}}" make it support supported (to support checkboxes)
[X]	: recursive self events need to check if a next for the event it's about to emit has been set already before emitting anything. (circular refs)
[x]	: proxyProtoObj.watch -> external watch prop api would be nice
[-]	: (this can be done with a watcher on a different item that can be reset manually) manually triggering renders (incase we need to bind to non proxied objects)
[ ] : make sure the watch function isn't called when the value didn't change
[ ] : Investigate if garbage collector has cleaned up removed nodes and make it so it dose
	[ ]	: create clean up last even at every render end
	[ ]	: make watching updates not rely on being passed the value to update
[ ] : make repeaters use document.createDocumentFragment() then inserting the fragment into the dom for better creation efficency
[ ]	: rework how inline experssions work ({::} executes once and the result replaces the experssion | {::}|{}| gets executed when the value is updated | no more max re-render loops)
[x]	: add callback for on render complete
[-]	: (This can be emulated with conditional {: :}'s and a command to set a certain value in the data object so so it wont be strictly nesesary for now but i'll leave the comment syntax in place and not taken for incase i need to add it later) || expand rebinding name -> remap on key change or on other data change for name attributes would be nice
[ ]	: nested foreach on the same level would be nice
[x]	: sharing model objects would be nice
[X]	: make repeat also watch for changes to the data object and rerun on array replace
